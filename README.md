# Assignment

 **The requirements are as follows:**
- 100,000+ rows.
- 15+ columns.

You are required to follow a typical ML pipeline with these datasets. You can decide to pick a dataset to predict continuous values (regression) or categories (classification).

**A typical Machine Learning pipeline includes the following:**
- 1-Data Preparation - obtaining and loading the data.
- 2-Data Preprocessing - cleaning the data (missing values, etc).
- 3-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - generating summaries and utilizing other statistical methods, and visualizing the data. 
- 4-Data Processing - feature selection/extraction and feature engineering.
- 5-Building a Model - splitting data into training and testing sets (holdout - optional), and training and testing chosen machine learning algorithms.
- 6-Model Evaluation - choosing metrics, applying metrics on predictions on the testing set, selecting the best model in your opinion.
